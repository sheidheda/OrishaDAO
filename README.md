# OrishaDAO

**OrishaDAO** is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) platform built on Clarity, empowering communities to govern, vote, and execute proposals with full transparency and decentralization. The platform is designed to ensure secure treasury management, fair governance, and community-driven decision-making.

## Features

- **Proposal Submission**: Members can submit governance proposals for the community.
- **Voting Mechanism**: Transparent voting system using governance tokens to weigh decisions.
- **Treasury Management**: Securely deposit, withdraw, and manage community funds.
- **Proposal Execution**: Execute approved proposals automatically using smart contracts.
  
## Smart Contracts

OrishaDAO operates using the following smart contracts:

1. **DAO Core Contract**: Manages proposal submissions, voting, and execution logic.
2. **Governance Token Contract**: Provides governance tokens for voting power.
3. **Treasury Contract**: Safeguards community funds and allows deposits and withdrawals.
4. **Proposal Execution Contract**: Executes the actions of successful proposals.

## How It Works

1. **Submit a Proposal**: Any community member can submit a proposal with a description.
2. **Vote**: Members vote using governance tokens, weighing decisions based on their token holdings.
3. **Execution**: Once a proposal passes, it is automatically executed, affecting the treasury or other defined actions.
